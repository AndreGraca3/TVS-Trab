### Exercise 1

**a) Compare Figure 5-17 with Figure 5-18. The change from 4-level mapping to 5-level mapping increases the maximum size of virtual address spaces. Calculate the maximum size for each case.**

----

**4-level mapping**

With 4-level mapping, each virtual address is 48 bits, the maximum size of the virtual address space is 2^48 bytes (256 TB).


**5-level mapping**

With 5-level mapping, each virtual address increases to 57 bits and the maximum size of the virtual address space to 2^57 bytes (128 PB).
